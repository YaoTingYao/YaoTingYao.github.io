									</header>

									<p>Cropland mapping is a crucial tool for evaluating food security. Crop fields in sub-Saharan
African countries expect to expand by more than three times in the next decade to satisfy food
demand. Developing accurate, large-area cropland maps of Africaâ€™s smallholder agricultural
systems is critical.</p>
									<p>To address this need, we use U-Net, a convolutional neural network, to map
cropland for the year 2022 in the Republic of Zambia, a country undergoing rapid agricultural
growth.</p>

									<h2 style="color:#e48bae;">Created a labeling platform and workflow protocol on Google Earth Engine (GEE)</h2>
									<p>We created 200 by 200 grids covering Zambia, created catalog and wrote R script randomly seeded 600 labels. We provided high spatial-resolution Planet-Scope satellite imagery grids (2.77m) of the growing and off season as well as NDVI imagery to create labels for training and evaluating the model, collecting a total of 5,977, 600 over Zambia and the remainder from the three other Africa countries (Kenya, Tanzania, Ghana, Republic of Congo).</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/gee.png" alt="" /></span>
                  <p>Used GEE API to create automation tools, including rasterize labels into 3 classes(field, non-field and field boundary), imagery downloader and imagery resampler.</p>

									<h2 style="color:#e48bae;">Model Training, Validation and Pridiction</h2>
									<p>We trained the model to
recognize three classes (field, non-field, and field boundary) for 200 epochs, using 80% of the
collected labels for training and 20% for validation, resulting in an F1 score of 0.66 for the field
interior class. We then fine-tuned the model on the labels for Zambia (F1 = 0.69), and the
mapped the predictions for the field interior class for the entire country and passed these
through a final segmentation step to convert the binary predictions into individual fields.</p>

									<p>     U-Net is one of the cutting-edge architectures of CNN for image segmentation. U-Net has U-shape construction path (encoder) and an expansion path (decoder) structure, in which the spatial scale is subsequently reduced after consecutive pooling operations and increased in a contracting path. This research use Pytorch and scikit-learn library to train model and predict results. </p>

                  <p>The
results demonstrate the value of applying neural network-based approaches with new sources
of high resolution imagery for cropland mapping because of its ability to detect individual fields
more effectively than approaches previously used to map Zambia (e.g. Random Forests). Future
opportunities exist to improve the model by collecting labels that better balancing the number
of labels among different classes, which includes improving the number of non-field labels on
landscapes that lead to false positives (e.g., wetland areas). In addition to improving the overall
accuracy, the maps provide additional valuable information on field size, which can be used to
understand the characteristics of the agricultural system. </p>
